rmgserver global variables
--------------------------
Reconfigurable variables are indicated by (*)

Integer Port;
	TCP/IP port to listen for incoming connections.

String LogWhichSystems; (*)
	default "abcdefg" (all systems on)
	Server subsystems to log messages. Each system is indicated by a
	letter; order is not important. Values are:

		a: protocol
		b: server
		c: resource handler/application/csap objects
		d: major system resources (ie, VHB)
		e: rsl language system
		f: application rsl scripts
		g: Protocol traffic only


Integer LogLevel; (*)
	default 4 (notice)
	Severity threshold below which server messages will be logged.

		6 = debug:     Programmer interest only.
		5 = info:      Periodic information.
		4 = notice:    Semi-important, non-error, normal events.
		3 = alert:     Infrequent, possibly unexpected, but important events.
		2 = error:     Something went wrong; RSL argument mismatch or other error.
		1 = fatal:     Bad error; server is going to die.
		0 = emergency: Panic!

Integer MaxUsers; (*)
	default 200
	Maximum allowed number of concurrent users. When the system is trying to
	shutdown, ie, when signaled by the `rmgadmin' program, this value is
	set to zero.

String MaxUserMessage; (*)
	default "Maximum user limit reached"
	Message that is sent in an alert to each user that attempts to connect
	when the system is "full" (MaxUsers).

Integer TotalAppsAllowed; (*)
	default 100
	Total number of users the system will see before the server will want
	to shut down. Shutdown will commence when the number of active user
	sessions drops to zero.
	
	If this value is zero, then there is no upper bound.

Integer MaxIdleTime; (*)
	default 160
	Default resource idle time before a Timeout event is sent to the resource.
	This is overridden by the RegisterTimeout method. (See `App').

Boolean DebugTitles; (*)
	default false
	true = Window titles are formatted as "<systemID> : <instanceID> <title>"
	false = regular titles.

Integer ShutdownTime; (*)
	default -1 (ie: do not shutdown)
	Seconds till all rmgservers shutdown.

String ReconfigFile;
	default "reconfig.rsl".
	Name of the dynamic configuration file (RSL) to run when
	signaled by the `rmgadmin' script.
