# rsl source

this is the source for a programming language called rsl, version 1, a scripting language, written
in 1995 and not touched since at least mid 1996.

Since it was written so long ago, I don't even know if what we have here is the final or least bug-free version.
That is probabably lost to the ages. The version here is the single one I have found laying around on my hard drive.

## caveats

this is being released for fun. It's not expected to work.  There are certainly pieces missing. It
was never intended to be open source (hence the hardcoded paths in the makefile)


## author

the design and core implementation of rsl was done by russell holt (holtrf in the source). Others have contributed pieces and bugfixes.
